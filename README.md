Board Game Engine regroups games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-Four.
It implements AI to play with (Min-Max, MonteCarlo, and random moves).
Its project is before all a pedagogical project to show the best practices to adopte when coding.

Feel free to update and fork the project :-)

## ToDo:

- [ ] Rename variable in english and enforce PEP 8 code style
- [ ] Add GUI support: Work In Progress
- [ ] Add Requierements.txt
- [ ] Convert it as python package

## GUI Description

The GUI will be build with the [eel python package](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel) with which we can build a beautifull cross-pateform HTML5 interface.

You can even try it directly for a to players connect-4 game: [Try Demo](https://louisgeisler.github.io/Board_Games_Engine_TicTacToe_and_ConnectFour/)
